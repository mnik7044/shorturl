URL Shortener

Design a URL shortener service that takes a valid url and returns a shortened url, redirecting
the user to the previously provided url

Also, keep track of total visits/clicks on the url

Routes

POST/URL - Generates a new short url and returns the shortened url in the format exampl.com/random-id

GET/:id - Redirects the user to the original url


GET/URL/analytics/:id - Returns the clicks for the provided short id
